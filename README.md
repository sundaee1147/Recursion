# Recursion

A test to see if a word is a palindrome. A word is a palindrome if only if it can be read from left to right or from right to left: gag; kayak; php; radar.

To test for this we compare the characters located at the beginning and end of the word:
if equality we test the rest of the word
if difference we stop
